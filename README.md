# DS_Salaries_EDA

This repository contains code for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization of data science salaries. The aim is to gain insightful patterns within compensation data, enabling evidence-based decision-making for employers and professionals in the analytics industry. The following steps were performed to accomplish this:

## Data Analysis
A dataset containing 3,755 data science-related salaries was analyzed using Python. The dataset was carefully examined to extract relevant information and understand the salary landscape in the data science field. Python libraries, such as pandas, were utilized to manipulate and explore the data.

## Visualization
To present key findings from the analysis, various data visualization techniques were employed. The following libraries were used to create informative and visually appealing visualizations:
* pandas: Used for data manipulation and aggregation
* matplotlib: Employed to create static visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, and histograms
* seaborn: Utilized to enhance the aesthetics of the visualizations and create more complex plots
* plotly: Used to create interactive and dynamic visualizations such as map to demonstrate where is the primary hub for professionals in this field

Through the use of these libraries, a total of 14 graphics were generated, showcasing important insights and contributing to a deeper understanding of the data science salary landscape.
